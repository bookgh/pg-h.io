# pg-h.io

## why pg-h.io?

I work within a linux vagrant box all day long for the most part. I ask programs for help, so this is my help page.

## what is the reason for this site?

I have always wanted to help others and I love what I do for work everyday. I would like to basically try to give out anything I've learned in the broad categories of IT, and this will be where I start writing those things out. I also like to continue learning, so this will also be a place where I can attempt to learn more.

## Linode Setup

I am currently running this site on Linode.com. I am used to working with CentOS 7, so that is the OS for the host I'm writing this for. The host is the minimum template with 1 CPU, 1GB of memory, and 20/25GB of Disk.

1. Stand up Linode Host and SSH in
1. Install GIT
1. Git clone ([https://github.com/silentpete/pg-h.io.git](https://github.com/silentpete/pg-h.io.git))
1. Run the Prep Script
1. Run the Start Script
