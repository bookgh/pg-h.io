SonarQube my Go
May 13, 2018
Use SonarQube to scan your Go code and see problems you didn't know where there.
# SonarQube

So I went to a meetup ([https://www.meetup.com/csopensource/events/249159179/](https://www.meetup.com/csopensource/events/249159179/)) and there was a presentation on SonarQube. Bill Lyons showed how he incorporated SonarQube into his teams' work flow and lower the amount of code quality issues from 40k down to 0.

From SonarQube.org: "SonarQube is an open source platform to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells and security vulnerabilities..."

## Get the code

I have created a local docker compose stack which allows for local code analysis and visual interaction with SonarQube.

Get the code:

- [https://github.com/silentpete/sonarqube](https://github.com/silentpete/sonarqube)

## How to use the code

Once the SonarQube repo has been cloned, the following commands will get the environment prepped.

1. Build the containers needed in the environment.
    ```none
    ./build_containers.sh
    ```

1. Start SonarQube.
    ```none
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

1. Start a SonarScanner in the directory of your choosing. For example, I checked out [https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), change directories to the ../prometheus/prometheus, and then ran the following:
    ```none
    docker run -dt --rm --name=sonarscanner -e PROJECTKEY="${PWD##*/}" -v $PWD/:/src/ --network=sonarqube_lan --log-driver=json-file sonarqube_scanner:latest; docker logs -f sonarscanner
    ```

When you see "EXECUTION SUCCESS", the code should be in the SonarQube

## To the GUI

Navigate to: [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

Login with the default username and password: `admin`

Once you are on the 'Projects' landing page, you will see your scanned code. From here you can select the project, then look at bugs, vulnerabilities, debt, code smells, coverage, and duplication. As you make changes and re-scan your code, the interface will reflect changes.

On the top bar, you can navigate quickly through Issues, Rules, Quality Profiles, Quality Gates, and Administration. To look at what is being applied, look at the Quality Profiles. Here you can see all of the different patterns being matched. To adjust from the built in, a copy of the Sonar Way is needed, then you can deactivate or add to the template.

## Clean up

Once you have checked your code and feel done with the quality scans, you can clean up your development environment. By running the docker compose down command, it will stop and remove the containers that were brought up. All state is kept in the containers, so after 'downing' the compose stack, no data should be left in your environment.

1. Remove the running compose environment.
    ```none
    docker-compose down
    ```

1. If you would like a little cleaner.
    ```none
    docker system prune -a -f
    ```
