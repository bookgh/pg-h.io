Go programming joyful moment.
# Success

So I finally finished going through the whole `Learn How To Code: Googleâ€™s Go (golang) Programming Language` course. I'm pretty happy as I do feel accomplished about sticking through it and finishing it. I have a much better understanding of the language. Thank you Todd!

## Get the Course

Go to: [https://greatercommons.com/](https://greatercommons.com/) first. Make an account and sign in, then go to: [https://greatercommons.com/cwg](https://greatercommons.com/cwg). Hopefully Todd is still able to provide free access. The course is totally worth it.

## My Next Project

Now I'm looking for a project... I think the first thing I want to do is refactor a sinatra container I have running at work. I think this should be pretty easy to swap out. I 'll update this post once I get it finished with some information about the updated container.
