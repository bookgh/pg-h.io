A Meetup Organizer!
# Founded Apr 27, 2018

So with this whole website, finding Go, trying to push myself and help anyone and everyone interested in tech... I've decided to start a Colorado Springs golang Meetup. I have a friend of mine that is going to co-host with me and a fellow co-worker interested in this journey.

## Getting past the fear

Since I first started looking to see if there was a golang meetup and didn't find one, I thought this is what I should do. I've been thinking about this regularly since I started doing Todd McCleod's Go class([https://www.greatercommons.com/](https://www.greatercommons.com/)). I am not sure if it is Todd repeatedly telling me to teach others myself, but maybe, I'm not sure, I'm just excited to do this. I reached out to another Go meetup organizer, talked with some friends, wife, mentors and no one said that it was a stupid idea. I also found [https://github.com/corylanou/go-meetup](https://github.com/corylanou/go-meetup) and Cory just says to go for it if you have "desire and ambition".

## So when is the first Meetup?

We are still working on completing the Meetup page and thinking things through... I would have liked to do the second Tuesday because it was November 10, 2009 when Go's birthday is, which is a second Tuesday. We are thinking we will make it the third Monday to start. Maybe we will adjust in the future once we're out of school and have some more freetime.

So that would put us at May 21st

I'm looking for a place to host the event. Need to look in COS for a spot that will have some available room to allow us to meet. Potentially could use my company meeting room, but we already host two other Meetups.
