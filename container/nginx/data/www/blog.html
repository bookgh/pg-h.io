<h1>Just put it out there...</h1>
<p>
After being a consumer of the internet for so long, thinking to myself I have nothing to offer… but! recently I have been told otherwise. I have listened to, or read, podcasts, books, articles and the random assortment of daily internet content, which says just put it out there and try to help others. So… maybe I'll find an audience that will find something I put out there beneficial.

<h2>Where I'm coming from...</h2>
<p>
I like to consider myself a generalist as I don't think I know anything very well, but have a broad knowledge. I have worked within the technology world for somewhere around eighteen years. I have worked at tiny companies, large companies, and I like the in-between personally. I enjoy working with all of the softwares and not just one or doing the same thing every day.

<h2>Where I think I'm going with this...</h2>
<p>
  I am currently in the pursuit of trying to develop my programming skills, chasing the Go language. I am looking to do this while online, giving out anything I learn along the way. I have been running through Todd McLeod’s learn how to program class (<a href="https://twitter.com/Todd_McLeod/status/976523161985458176" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/Todd_McLeod/status/976523161985458176</a>) when I’m not working or living life. I have been having a great time, enough to detour me away from the Udacity scholarship Android class. I don’t like how that class was being taught, I feel like Todd does a great job and is more my style of learning. I really enjoy what I’ve used with Go and how the community around the language is. I can’t wait to see where this all goes and I hope to fail and learn along the way.
